# Connecting to AWS

## Introduction

This lab guides you through the steps involved in connecting to an AWS EC2 F1 instance, and starting and stopping the instance.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Connect to an AWS EC2 F1 instance using the provided credentials
- Start an instance
- Start a RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) session
- Close the RDP session
- Stop the instance

## Steps
Each registered participant has been allocated a pre-configured EC2 F1 instance and should have received an email with the following details:  

- Account ID, 
- IAM username, 
- Link to access a preconfigured EC2 F1 instance

### Login into the AWS and starting an F1 instance

1. Start a web browser session
1. Either click on the provided link to open up an AWS login page OR enter [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) to open a login page  
    If you had used the link then you should see a login page similar to shown here:

1. Type the following command to terminate the RDP session and shutdown the instance
   ```
      sudo shutdown now	  
   ```
1. Check the browser window, you will see status as either **Stopping** or **Stopped.** Click on the refresh button to see the status update

## Appendix: Interacting with the Instance using Putty

1. Start PuTTY program
1. Enter _centos@&lt;public\_dns\_entry&gt;_ in the **Host Name** field and **22** in the _Port_ field  
Make sure that SSH is selected as the Connection type
